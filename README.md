## Iteration 3
For this Iteration we implemented our random quote story. We encountered a few problems with linking our quotes database to our front page, but after some hard work (thanks Matthew!) we got it working. Wrapped up things from Iteration 1, and began laying the groundwork for Iteration 4. Alex fully implemented tagging functionality, added an About page, and updated the main menu bar. Sammy created the schema/controller for the quotes display.
Matthew created and uploaded over 100 quotes and put them into mlab. Matthew also created the quotes module, and fully implemented what Sammy had done.

## Iteration 2
For this Iteration we began to personalize the site. There were no sizable problems that we ran into during this iteration. Matthew copied the Articles module and made it into a Siifts module so users can create their own Siifts. Sam set up the filter for the Siifts module so that Users can only see the Siifts they themselves have created. Alex created the logo for Siift.ly, added detailed information about Siift.ly's mission, and implemented partial tag functionality.

## Iteration 1

We did not encounter any significant issues in implementing the Calendar module. We made the "Add Private Event" button only show up when a user is logged in. We chose a nice orange color for the Private Events. We all worked together in class and Friday evening, each tackling one or two of the subtasks outlined in the assignment. Specifically, Sam tackled work with the server, Alex worked on the Angular controls, and Matthew worked on the HTML/CSS front end.
