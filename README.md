## Iteration 1

We did not encounter any significant issues in implementing the Calendar module. We made the "Add Private Event" button only show up when a user is logged in. We chose a nice orange color for the Private Events. We all worked together in class and Friday evening, each tackling one or two of the subtasks outlined in the assignment. Specifically, Sam tackled work with the server, Alex worked on the Angular controls, and I worked on the HTML/CSS front end.
