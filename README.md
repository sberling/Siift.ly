## Iteration 1

We did not encounter any significant issues in implementing the Calendar module. We made the "Add Private Event" button only show up when a user is logged in. We chose a nice orange color for the Private Events. We all worked together in class and Friday evening, each tackling one or two of the subtasks outlined in the assignment.
